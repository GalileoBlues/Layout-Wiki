## The Objective:

Archival of alternate keyboard layouts from the AKL discord, reasoning from the creators, terminology used,
and generators used to create layouts

I personally found that outside the AKL discord community there was a large gap in knowledge in alternate layouts,
Anecdotally i find the live enviroment of sharing layouts and receiving feedback or criticism to be constructive
and thus it becomes a place where you can learn a lot very quickly ranging from experts in layout design with their own layout generators
or from people who are ungodly fast at typing with alternate layouts and qwerty.

The problem is with documentation, Private discord servers are by nature an insular and information distributed there is not
freely available anywhere else sometimes and that is the case with the AKL discord.

often i find alternate layouts outside the community that people praise without understanding, without metrics, without consideration
of higher level statistics. So i have started this wiki in the hopes that it will act as a place for people to learn about
what i consider to be the best layouts and information on layouts on the internet.

Further plans for the wiki are complete descriptions of atleast one prominent layout of each creator, have an in-depth page going into technical and non-technical detail and creating a website hosted here to move the wiki pages to.
